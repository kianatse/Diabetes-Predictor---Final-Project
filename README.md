# Diabetes Prediction Model

Our projectâ€™s goal is to create a simple biomedical model of diabetes risk assessment. Diabetes is a widespread, chronic disease that affects about 12% of the US adult population. It may lead to serious consequences if not treated or detected early. The model will predict the likelihood of a patient having or developing the condition, based on the datasets found on heart disease, diabetes health indicators, glucose levels, etc. With this information, patients can initiate lifestyle changes to improve their conditions. With this model, we aim to be more proactive and preventative concerning the spread of diabetes. This project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health-related attributes using a Random Forest Classifier.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for training the model is bundled as a `.zip` file (`Group13_Data.zip`) in the repository. This dataset was chosen because of the many indicators it had included, allowing our model to be much more all-inclusive and efficient. It includes health-related attributes and a binary target variable (`Diabetes_binary`) indicating the presence of diabetes.

## **How to Run the Code**

### **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.7 or later)
- `pip` (Python package manager)

---

### **2. Clone the Repository**
Follow these steps to clone the repository to your local environment:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jordynrichardson/Diabetes-Predictor---Final-Project.git
   ```
3. Navigate into the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd Diabetes-Predictor---Final-Project
   ```

---

### **3. Ensure the Dataset is Present in the Repository Root**
1. Check if the dataset (`Group13_Data.zip`) is in the repository root:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   - If you see `Group13_Data.zip` listed, the dataset is already in the root directory.

2. If the dataset is missing:
   - Download the dataset from the source ([Placeholder for Dataset URL or Description]).
   - Move the file to the repository root:
     ```bash
     mv /path/to/Group13_Data.zip /path/to/Diabetes-Predictor---Final-Project/
     ```

3. Verify the dataset is now in the root directory:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

---

### **4. Install Dependencies**
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **5. Run the Script**
Run the Python script to train the model, evaluate it, and start the prediction demo:
```bash
python Group13_Code.py
```

---

### **6. Follow the Interactive Demo**
The script includes a demo where you can input health-related values to get predictions:
- Enter the feature values when prompted.
- All except the following will be answered with binary values '1' for yes, '0' for no: BMI and Age
- The script will output whether the prediction is `Diabetes` or `No Diabetes`.

---

### **7. Check the Generated Model File**
After running the script, the trained model will be saved as `diabetes_model.pkl.gz` in the repository directory. You can use this file for inference in future runs without retraining.

## **How the Code Works**
1. **Dataset Extraction**:
   - A `.zip` file is extracted to retrieve the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Features and the target variable are selected, and optional feature selection is applied.
3. **Model Training**:
   - A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the dataset.
4. **Model Saving**:
   - The trained model is saved as a compressed `.pkl.gz` file.
5. **Interactive Demo**:
   - Users can input feature values to predict if diabetes is likely.
