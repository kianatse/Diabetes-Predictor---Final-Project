# Diabetes-Predictor---Final-Project
Diabetes Predictor - Final Project
Overview
The Diabetes Predictor is a Python-based project that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. This tool aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying potential diabetes cases early by leveraging data and predictive modeling.

Features
Machine Learning Model: Uses advanced algorithms to predict diabetes likelihood.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple input format for user data.
Accurate Predictions: Trained on a reliable dataset for accurate results.
Fully Open Source: Contributions are welcome!
Installation
To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/kianatse/Diabetes-Predictor---Final-Project.git
cd Diabetes-Predictor---Final-Project
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
